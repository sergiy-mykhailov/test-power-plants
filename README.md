* The Household has Electricity if it's connected to one or more Power Plants.
* Each Power Plant is alive by default, but can be killed.
* The Power Plant which is not Alive will not generate any Electricity.
* Household can be connected to Household.
* The Household which has the Electricity also passes it to all the connected Households.
* The Power Plant can be repaired after killed.
